**syzygy21/syzygy21** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- I’m currently working on applying instance segmentation to seperate the region of interest from images of 3d printed parts so as to carry out their measurements
- I’m have extensive experience with computer vision, deep learning, AI.
- I also have experience with robotics control, path planning, ROS, Gazebo
- I’m looking to collaborate on any research project that involves multimodal deep learning, 3d deep learning and generative AI.
- Currently a robotics masters student at UMD.
